    "## Overview of SDLC\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us get an overview of SDLC. It's full form is **Software Development Life Cycle**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let us go through the typically SDLC.\n",
    "  * We start with requirements, then design and then development.\n",
    "  * Once the code is developed, it will go through multiple levels of testing.\n",
    "    * Integration\n",
    "    * Functionality Testing\n",
    "    * User Acceptance Testing\n",
    "  * Once the code is thoroughly tested, it will go to production.\n",
    "  * Any application will go through at least development, one cycle of testing and then production.\n",
    "  * Design, Development, Testing, Production are called as Phases.\n",
    "* For each phase we will have phase specific external systems the application might have to talk to.\n",
    "* The most commonly used ones are database, 3rd party REST API Gateways.\n",
    "* For security reasons, we need to use different databases and REST API Gateways with different values.\n",
    "* We should not hardcode as part of the application. One of the way to pass these phase specific variables is by leveraging environment variables.\n",
    "* Let us undertand how it can be handled using `os` module as part of the subsequent topics in this section. There are alternative ways as well.\n",
    "  * Using `configparser` by specifying phase specific values in the form of JSON, YAML etc."
