* While creating tables in RDBMS databases, we should specify data types for the columns.
  * SERIAL is nothing but integer which is populated by a special database object called as   sequence. It is typically used for surrogate primary key.
  * When SERIAL is specified, a sequence with table_name_serial_column_seq naming      convention will be created. In our case it is users_user_id_seq.

As our database table creation and data insertion script is quite big, we have used command line approach. However, we should always be able to run simple scripts using SQL Workbench itself. We should be able to perform all the permitted operations based on permissions given to user used to connect to database.

As connectivity between SQL Workbench and MySQL on docker is validated, now one should be able to quickly take care of SQL exercises.

* Check the version of anaconda - `brew cask info anaconda`
* Install anaconda3 - `brew cask install anaconda`
* Clone GitHub Repository - `git clone https://github.com/dgadiraju/itversit...`
* Get into the folder - `cd itversity-books`
* Launch Jupyter Lab and start learning using the books available as part of the repository. - `/opt/local/anaconda3/bin/jupyter lab`
* You can also launch `Anaconda Navigator` UI and launch Jupyter Lab from it. However it will open the folders from Home Directory, you just need to ensure to navigate to appropriate folder that contain books and start practicing as demonstrated.

You can build virtual machine for the practice using this Vagrant File available in this GitHub Repository - https://github.com/dgadiraju/itversity-boxes

In case if you want to install Virtualbox and Vagrant before using Vagrant box provided, feel free to watch this 1 hour video and then go ahead and start using vagrant commands to leverage the new virtual machine with Spark and content - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osPz2_pclTk

"ubP0QxxTilA","UCakdSIPsJqiOLqylgoYmwQg","03 Create HDFS User for retail using keytab",,"How to manage functional users such as retail in Kerberized Hadoop and Spark Clusters?

Earlier we have seen the most straight forward way - create principal with password and then create tickets from the servers from where you want to submit the jobs.

However there are few caveats with this approach.

* Every time you want to create a ticket you will be prompted for the password. It will make the automation tough.
* If some one hacked into other servers with the functional user (retail) and if he know the password for the principal, he can create tickets and perform operations in the cluster.

To address these 2 issues, we typically use key based approach.
* Create principal with random key
* Generate Keytab file
* Copy the Keytab file to the desired servers from which you want to authenticate users.
* Change the ownership and restrict permissions on the Keytab file.

Now the user such as retail can only perform the tasks from those nodes where there is Keytab file. This approach will solve both the above mentioned problems and enhances security in kerberized cluster.

"cX2BmiXlWy0","UCakdSIPsJqiOLqylgoYmwQg","15 Review Kerberized Cluster",,"While creating the content on Kerberizing Cloudera Cluster, this question haunted me. As things are simplified using Cloudera Manager Wizard, what happens internally? Unless I understand those details, I will not be able to support.

if you are also curious, here is the answer for that. We are in the process of simplifying Kerberos concepts.

* Principals will be created and then Keytab files will be generated based up on the cluster topology.
* There will be several properties changes for each and every service in the cluster to use Kerberos for authentication and authorization.
* When ever you manage the service using Cloudera Manager, the underlying service owner will run kinit command using keytab file against principal to get the ticket.
* Keytab files generated in KDC will be copied to internal folders which are used by Cloudera.
* Typically tickets will be destroyed once the task is performed.

High level steps to create Hadoop Clusters using Distributions for PoCs with extreme automation on Cloud!!!

* Use Terraform to provision servers from Cloud Platform with desired configuration of each of the server.
* Setup Ansible to take care of all pre-requisites
* Setup Cluster with Distribution of your choice
* Configure High Availability for key services like HDFS, YARN etc
* Enable Kerberos if security is key and want to evaluate security features
* Run validations using some pre-defined scripts to ensure every thing is fine

With pre-defined Terraform Scripts, Ansible Playbooks and Commands - we will be able to deliver all this with in 2 weeks. We can also provide support on Data Engineering for PoC.

P. S.: I am working on a course where you will see how to create a cluster quickly and enable Kerberos on top of it (3, 4 and 5 in the above list).

Stay tuned, if you are interested in taking up this course. This course will be idle for experienced Big Data Developers to understand Hadoop and Spark from administration perspective. You can implement this on any cloud platform with nominal costs to get hands on exposure.

You can get this course for $10.

"SmLx4VXbHho","UCakdSIPsJqiOLqylgoYmwQg","Apache Spark - How to determine executors for a given Spark Job?",,"Following is the question from one of my Self Paced Data Engineering Bootcamp 6 Student.

https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/data-engineering-bootcamp/

Topic Link: http://discuss.itversity.com/t/apache-spark-how-to-determine-executors-for-a-given-spark-job/17742

How does a developer arrive at a decision to pass control arguments to override the executor memory and cores in a spark job ? Is there a decision-making hierarchy in engineering teams that the developer would have to go through?
As part of this live session/pre-recorded video, I will answer the above question. Here are the details which need to be understood.

* Cluster Capacity - YARN (or Mesos)
* Static Allocation vs. Dynamic Allocation
* Determining and use Capacity based on the requirement
* Setting Properties at Run Time
* Setting Properties Programmatically
* Overview of --num-executors, --executor-cores, --executor-memory
* Decision Making Hierarchy

Demos are given using our state of the art labs. If you are interested you can sign up at https://labs.itversity.com

* By default, data will be streamed as data frames to executor 
   tasks as data being processed.
* Here is what will happen when data is read into executor task 
   while it is being processed
    * Deserialize into object
    * Stream into memory
    * Process data by executor task by applying logic
    * Flush deserialized objects from memory as executor tasks are 
       terminated
* Some times we might have to read same data multiple times for 
   processing with in the same job. By default every time data need 
   to be deserialized and submitted to executor tasks for 
   processing
* To avoid deserializing into java objects when same data have to 
   be read multiple times we can leverage caching.
* There are 2 methods persist and cache. By default with data 
   frames caching will be done as MEMORY_AND_DISK from Spark 
   2.
* cache is shorthand method for persist at MEMORY_AND_DISK
* This is what happens when we cache Data Frame
    * Caching will be done only when data is read at least once for 
       processing
    * Each record will be deserialized into object
    * These deserialized objects will be cached in memory as long 
       as they fit
    * If not, deserialized objects will be spilled out to disk
* You can get details about different persistence levels from here.

* We can read text data into RDD using SparkContext’s textFile. It 
   will treat newline character as a record delimiter.
* We have to parse each record in RDD and derive data to process 
   further

* Both of them use newline character as a record delimiter. When 
   we use csv API to create data frame we can also specify field 
   separator/delimiter using sep as one of the options.
* We can also specify sep while writing data into text files with any 
   field separator or delimiter using csv API. Also, we can 
   concatenate data as part of selectExpr with a delimiter of our 
   choice and use text API.
* Here is the example to read and write data with ascii null 
   character.

* Hive is used to create databases, tables and process data in Big 
   Data Clusters.
* It uses HDFS for the file system. A Hive database or a table or a 
   partition is nothing but a directory in HDFS.
* Once we create table metadata will be stored in an RDBMS 
   database configured. We have configured our Hive with MySQL.
* Hive also have query engine. A query will be typically compiled 
   into Map Reduce Job.
* Once we have tables created, we can run queries using different 
   query engines.
    * Hive
    * Tez
    * Impala
    * Spark SQL
    * Presto
    * and more
* Hive support DDL, batch data load as well as inserting query 
   results on top of running SQL type queries.
* Let us create Hive Database, create few tables and process using 
   standard Hive Queries before we jump into Spark SQL.

* We have functions such as sum, avg, min, max etc which can be 
   used to aggregate the data.
* We need to create WindowSpec object using partitionBy to get 
   aggregations within each group.
* Some realistic use cases
     * Get the average salary for each department and get all 
        employee details who earn more than the average salary
     * Get average revenue for each day and get all the orders who 
        earn revenue more than average revenue
     * Get the highest order revenue and get all the orders which 
        have revenue more than 75% of the revenue

* Window have APIs such as partitionBy, orderBy etc
* These APIs (such as partitionBy) return WindowSpec object. We 
   can pass WindowSpec object to over on functions such as rank(), 
   dense_rank(), sum() etc
* Syntax: rank().over(spec) where spec = 
   Window.partitionBy(‘ColumnName’)
* Aggregations – sum, avg, min, max etc
* Ranking – rank, dense_rank, row_number etc
* Windowing – lead, lag etc

To get access to complete course which contains videos, reference material, code, labs and support, - you need to purchase https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/data-engineering-bootcamp/

* We need to first understand the relationship with respect to data 
   sets
* All our data sets have relationships defined between them.
    * orders and order_items are transaction tables. orders is parent 
       and order_items is a child. The relationship is established 
       between the two using order_id (in order_items, it is 
       represented as order_item_order_id)
    * We also have product catalog normalized into 3 tables – 
       products, categories, and departments (with relationships esta 
       blished in that order)
    * We also have a customers table
    * There is relationship between customers and orders – 
       customers is parent data set as one customer can place 
       multiple orders.
    * There is a relationship between the product catalog and 
       order_items via products – products is parent data set as one 
       product can be ordered as part of multiple order_items.
* Determine the type of join – inner or outer (left or right or full)
* Data Frames have an API called join to perform joins
* We can make the join outer by passing an additional argument
* By default joins are broadcast. It is similar to look up in the 
   conventional ETL process. Copy of smaller data set will be 
   broadcasted on to all the nodes rather than joining via shuffling 
   between the stages.
* Beyond a pre-configured broadcast size, join will be done using 
   shuffling process.

* There are simple UDFs as well as Aggregated UDFs. For now, we 
   will focus on simple UDFs.
* We can create variable for function and convert into UDF, using 
   org.apache.spark.sql.functions.udf. It will return object of type 
   org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedFunction
* Once UDF is created we can use it as part of any transformation 
   function such as select, where, filter, groupBy etc by using Data 
   Frame Native approach.
* However, if we want to use it as part of SQL style syntax, we need 
   to register UDF as SQL function. We can do so, by using 
   spark.register.udf.

   while applying functions.
* We can take care of it using selectExpr. Whatever functions we 
   pass to selectExpr should follow Hive syntax. If we use split, we 
   need to use [] to access elements from the array generated as 
   result for the split.
* We also have expr which works in similar fashion while using

* We have already seen spark.read to read the data
* We also have write APIs on top of Data Frames which can be 
   used to save Data Frame to underlying File System.
* org.apache.spark.sql have several other APIs for different 
   purposes.
    * org.apache.spark.sql.types for pre-defined types or to create 
       schemas dynamically.
    * org.apache.spark.sql.functions for pre-defined functions
    * createTempView or createOrReplaceTempView on top of Data 
      Frame to register it as in-memory view and process data using 
      SQL based Queries.
    * spark.sql to run queries from Hive Tables or temporary views 
       or even Hive commands
    * org.apache.spark.sql.functions.udf to create User Defined 
       Functions for Data Frame Operations.
    * spark.register.udf to register standard Scala Functions as SQL 
       functions.

* We get getters and setters with case classes.
* It implements Serializable and Product
* While Serializable gives us functionality to convert the object to 
   the data stream, Product will give us functionality such as 
   productArity, productIterator etc.
* productArity gives us the number of elements while 
   productIterator convert case class attribute values to the

   convert data in flat files into Data Frames directly.
* There are some file formats which are available on sc, but not on 
   spark.read. In those scenarios we might have to load data from 
   files into RDD, extract information using map and then create 
   Data Frame.
* Let us see an example where we read comma separated data

    * Apply map to convert data into tuple with right data type
    * Use toDF to create Data Frame. We can define data types while

   Allocation Settings. Allocation can be either static or dynamic.
* These resources are nothing but Executors. From YARN 
   perspective they are Containers.
* The Executor is nothing but JVM which can run multiple

To get access to complete course which contains videos, reference material, code, labs and support, - you need to purchase https://kaizen.itversity.com/shop/all-courses/data-engineering-bootcamp/

* Local Mode
* Stand Alone Mode (Spark Native)
* Mesos Mode
* YARN Mode

Local and Stand Alone is used for development and exploratory purposes. In Production we either use Mesos or YARN.

   * Most of the Big Data distributions such as Cloudera, 
      Hortonworks etc have eco system of tools such as Kafka, 
      Hadoop etc along with Spark.
   * They are typically deployed using YARN, while Spark exclusive 
      clusters typically use Mesos.
   * As our clusters are either built using Hortonworks or Cloudera 
      Distribution, we tend to run our Spark Jobs using YARN mode.
   * We can make YARN default while setting up clusters. However, 
      if the cluster is configured to use local mode, then we can 
      overwrite it by using –master as part of spark-submit or spark - 
      shell

* –packages can be used to download the jar file from 
   repositorites over internet. We need to pass group id, artifact id 
   and version using colon as delimiter.

APIs on top of RDDs are categorized into Transformations and Actions.

* Transformations take RDD as input and return another RDD as 
   output.
    * Row-level transformations – map and flatMap
    * Filtering data – filter
    * Aggregations – reduceByKey, aggregateByKey
    * Joins – join, leftOuterJoin, rightOuterJoin
    * Sorting – sortByKey
    * Ranking can be done with groupByKey along with anonymous 
       functions
    * Set Operations – union, intersection
* When transformations are used, Spark Job will not run 
   immediately. It will update DAG.
* Actions take RDD as input and perform the specified action such 
   as converting RDD into the local collection in driver program or 
   save into file system.
* Action trigger execution of the Spark Job. If there are multiple 
   actions in the Spark application, each of that action triggers a 
   new job.
* DAG stands for Directed Acyclic Graph and the process of 
   deferring execution until action is performed is called as lazy 
   evaluation.

* Every application will have a runtime configuration. For Spark it is 
   SparkConf.
* SparkConf has several APIs to set and get the properties. We can 
   overwrite any property using set.
* There are some additional APIs such as appName, master etc. 
   appName is a handy function which overwrites spark.app.name 
   property while master overwrites spark.master property.
* Once the SparkConf object is created, it can be passed to the 
   constructor of SparkContext to create a context object.
      * It will get the resources from the underlying framework (YARN, 
         Mesos, Stand Alone or local)
      * It will start web service on port number 4040 (we can override 
         by overwriting the value for spark.ui.port)
* SparkContext object exposes several APIs which include those 
   APIs that can be used to read the data from files (e. g.: textFile, 
   sequenceFile etc)
* We have to set all the properties first using SparkConf object and 
   then create a SparkContext object.

* We can apply the map to extract order_item_subtotal for each 
   record in the collection.
* Once we get order_item_subtotal for each item we can add those 
   to get total order revenue.
* We can validate using IDE by passing Run Time arguments
* Once this is done we can use sbt and build jar file out of it
   * Go to the project working directory
   * Run sbt package
   * You will see jar file under target/scala_2.11

* scala.io package has few simple APIs which read data from the

* To read data from File we can use this API – 
   scala.io.Source.fromFile(“PATH_TO_FILE”)
* It will create an object of type BufferedSource
* We can apply getLines on top of BufferedSource to create non- 
   empty Iterator where each element is of type String (we have 
   passed text file as path earlier)
* Once we got the iterator, we can convert into any collection type 
   based upon our requirement.

* We can launch Scala REPL using Scala
* REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop. It is an 
   interactive way of building logic.
* You can perform arithmetic operations, invoke functions, or even 
   develop functions.
* Each line of code is evaluated separately by being compiled into 
  Java bytecode. Hence many times each line can be treated in an 
   isolated way. Due to that, we should be able to define variables 
   with the same name.

* Now install IntelliJ
* There are 2 versions of IntelliJ community edition and enterprise 
   edition
* Community edition is free and at times you need to install 
   additional plugins
* Enterprise edition is paid and supported and comes with most of 
   the important plugins pre-installed. Also set of plugins are 
   bundled together as part of enterprise edition
* Unless you have corporate license for now consider installing 
   community edition.
* Why IntelliJ?
  * IntelliJ is created by JetBrains and it is very popular in building 
     IDEs which boost productivity in team development
  * Scala and SBT can be added as plugins using IntelliJ
  * Most commonly used tools such as git comes out of the box for versioning the code in the process of application development by teams.
* How to Install?
  * Go to the downloads page and make sure right version is chosen.
  * Once downloaded, just double click on installable and follow 
     typical installation process
* How to validate?
  * We will develop a program as part of next section to validate.

* Why to setup Spark?
   * Before deploying on the cluster, it is good practice to test the 
      script using spark-submit.
   * To run using spark-submit locally, it is nice to setup Spark on 
      Windows
* How to setup Spark?
   * Install 7z so that we can unzip and untar spark tar ball, from here
   * Download spark 2.3 tar ball by going here
       * Choose Spark Release: 2.3.0
       * Choose a package type: Pre-built for Hadoop 2.7 or later
       * It gives the appropriate link pointing to mirror
       * Click on it go to mirror and click on it to download
       * Use 7z software to unzip and under to complete setup of 
          spark
* We need to configure environment variables to run Spark any 
   where
* Keep in mind that Spark is not very well supported on Windows 
   and we will see how to setup on Ubuntu using Windows 
   subsystem for Linux.

* Before getting started check whether Java and JDK are installed or not
* Launch command prompt – Go to search bar on windows laptop, type cmd and hit enter
* Type java -version If it return version, check whether 1.8 or not. It is better to have 1.8 version. If you have other version, consider uninstall and install 1.8 (Search for programs installed and uninstall Java)
* Type javac -version If it return version, check whether 1.8 or not. It is better to have 1.8 version. If you have other version, consider uninstall and install 1.8 (Search for programs installed and uninstall Java)
* If you need other versions, make sure environment variables point to 1.8
* If you do not have Java at all, make sure to follow the instructions and install 1.8 version of JRE and JDK.
* Why do we need to install Java and JDK? Scala, Spark and many other technologies require Java and JDK to develop and build the applications. Scala is JVM based programming language.
* How to install Java and JDK? 
  * Go to official page of Oracle where downloads are available
  * Accept the terms and download 64 bit version
* How to validate?
  * Use java -version and javac -version commands in command prompt and see they return 1.8 or not

* What is big data on cloud?
* Why we should go for cloud with respect to Big Data?
* Why AWS and why EMR and other Big Data Technologies on AWS?
* Setting up EMR cluster and running Spark jobs
* EMR, Red Shift, Dynamo, Kinesis etc
* AWS Certifications with respect to Big Data
* Pre-announcement of corporate LMS

This will be complete hands on and I might have few challenges as I am doing for the first time. But we will improvise on the content for future.

1. Use full clone on VMWare Workstation
2. rm /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
3. Bring down eth1 ""ifconfig eth1 down""
4. Update /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0, change ipaddress to more appropriate one (only last octet)
5. Update /etc/sysconfig/network, change the value of HOSTNAME
6. Update /etc/hosts, modify both ip address and alias.

Many of my Texas friends are not aware of how electricity industry is run in Texas and they used to get ripped off by TXU, Reliant and many other companies. I shared information provided in the video with them and they end up saving up to 300$ to 600$ per year. So, I thought of providing a video which explains how to choose your electricity provider using powertochoose.org

Save and enjoy your hard earned dollars by going to powertochoose.org when ever you are due for renewal.

Please like it and comment how much you save as I am planning for an automated web application if there is good response to this video. Connect with me or follow me at
