    "## Common Issues with Primitive Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the common issues with primitive solution.\n",
    "* The solution does not follow software engineerig principles such as modularizing the solution, reusability of the code, readability of the code to an extent and many more.\n",
    "* As code is not modularized properly, you can see redundancy of the code.\n",
    "  * The code related to loading data into stations and station_rental_types is almost similar except for the insert query string.\n",
    "  * If we want to change the logic for any performance reasons, we need to change the code separately for inserting data into stations as well as station_rental_types.\n",
    "  * Even the code which converts the dataframe into list of lists or list of tuples before loading into the database tables is same.\n",
    "* Here is what we are supposed to do.\n",
    "  * Analyze the complete problem statement.\n",
    "  * Map to what you are familiar with and what you are not familiar with.\n",
    "  * Divide the solution into manageable components. For Data Engineering problems, we can divide the problem into **read**, **process**, **write** at a high level. You can further divide into smaller components in a hierarchy.\n",
    "  * Solve those smaller components based upon your skills and past experience and tackle unknown stuff in parallel.\n",
    "* Let us assume that we are good in loading the data into the table. We are trying to load stations and station_rental_types.\n",
    "* By developing a generic function which takes data frame and table name as arguments, we are done with code related to loading both the tables.\n",
    "* As part of the next topic we will understand how we can develop common function which can be used to load a data frame into the table passed. As long as both data frame and table structure are consistent, it should work."
